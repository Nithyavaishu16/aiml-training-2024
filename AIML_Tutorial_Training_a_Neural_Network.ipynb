        "Neural networks are a set of algorithms inspired by the functioning of the human brain. When you open your eyes, the information you perceive, known as data, is processed by neurons, which are the data processing cells in your brain. These neurons recognize patterns in the data and enable you to identify and understand your surroundings.\n",

        "Here is an example of Neural Network trying to predict the image data that given to it(the image data is 28x28 pixels, thats 784 pixels at input neurons). it predicts that the no is 2 here:\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Data\n",
        "  The type of data a neural network processes varies drastically based on the problem being solved. When we build a neural network, we define what shape and kind of data it can accept. It may sometimes be neccessary to modify our dataset so that it can be passed to our neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Layers\n",
        "  As we mentioned earlier each neural network consists of multiple layers. At each layer a different transformation of data occurs. Our initial input data is fed through the layers and eventually arrives at the output layer where we will obtain the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Input Layer:\n",
        "  The input layer is the layer that our initial data is passed to. It is the first layer in our neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Output Layer:\n",
        "  The output layer is the layer that we will retrive our results from. Once the data has passed through all other layers it will arrive here.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Hidden Layer(s):\n",
        "  All the other layers in our neural network are called \"hidden layers\". This is because they are hidden to us, we cannot observe them. Most neural networks consist of at least one hidden layer but can have an unlimited amount. Typically, the more complex the model the more hidden layers.\n",

        "### 3. Neurons\n",
        "\n",
        "Each layer is made up of what are called neurons. For example, say we want to pass an image that is 28x28 pixels, thats 784 pixels. We would need 784 neurons in our input layer to capture each of these pixels.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Weights\n",
        "  Weights are associated with each connection in our neural network. Every pair of connected nodes will have one weight that denotes the strength of the connection between them. The model will try to determine what these weights should be to achieve the best result. Weights start out at a constant or random value and will change as the network sees training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Biases\n",
        "\n",
        "  A bias is simply a constant value associated with each layer. It can be thought of as an extra neuron that has no connections. The purpose of a bias is to shift an entire activation function by a constant value. This allows a lot more flexibllity when it comes to choosing an activation and training the network. There is one bias for each layer.\n",
